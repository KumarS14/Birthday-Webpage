                <p>Hey Priyu! I thought it would be nice if I talked about how we met and grew together.
                We met on yubo and I was basically just swiping until I saw you and at the start I noticed two things about you
                which were  how sweet and kind and caring you looked due to your incredible smile you just looked like a 
                 kind and good hearted person who could shine up a whole room with there smile and im glad to say my assumptions were true. </p>
                <p>Once we got to know eachother and become friends I knew you were going to be in my life
                    forever just of how fun it was talking to you.I remember how we used to message everyday and just have silly and fun
                    conversations , I remember how we would update eachother on the smallest of things and be there foreachother each and everyday. I remember how you used to
                    tell me goodnight and sweet dreams arent made of cheese everyday and how relaxed it made me.
                    During that time I realised there was no one like you and there never will and how lucky I am to have met you.

                </p>
                <p>Once I got to know your hobbies and interests I love how unique they are like architecture
                    something we both love and share a interest in it was just amazing to hear
                </p>
                <p>As time went by and uni was looming near at the time I was pretty afraid of you replacing me and no longer talking to me anymore
                    just becuase it happend so much before and thats when I had a mental breakdown so many people left me at that time I was afraid of losing you too
                    and thats when I stupidly said I wanted to end things with us and I pray and thank god everyday you fought back I cant imagine a world withouth you 
                    and im forever greatful you thought I was worthy enough to remain in your life hardly anyone has done that before and when you did that it gave me hope 
                    of me overcoming my OCD and having you support me along the way
                </p>
                <p>After you fought back and refused to let me go it changed me in so many ways ill never be able to describe.
                    It made me feel confident , it made me cherised and it made me feel better about myself and change the way
                    I percieve the world I was so nihilistic back then but after that day you gave me hope and now I wake up with a smile excited to work hard so I can see you one day and spend the rest of our lives
                    with each other in it
                </p>
    
                <p>Ofc I do still miss how often we used to talk and how you would frantically message me while running to the tram
                    and how you would ask me to chatgpt things for your architecture work and how you would always send me pics of your projects and get me to choose the best ones
                    ill always remember when for a small amount of time your special person was me and ill always look fondly and proudly at when I was that important to you. So im not going anywhere! I dont care if it takes you a month to reply or a year your too special to me now for my OCD to ever ruin things again
                    im confident and happy that your going to be in my life forever so dont worry about me im always going to be here when you need me and im never going away.
